## My process

The project was very straightforward and easy. I began with a mobile-first approach and later implemented a media query to handle the desktop view. I added my own active and focus state styling for the buttons.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM
- SCSS

### What I learned

I have learned about the `aria-label` attribute. It is used in web development to provide an accessible label for an element that may not have a visible label. It is particularly important for users who rely on assistive technologies such as screen readers to navigate and interact with web content.

Here is a common use case for the `aria-label` attribute:

```html
<a class="Button" href="#" aria-label="Follow us on Facebook">
  <svg class="Icon Icon-facebook" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
    <!-- ... -->
  </svg>
</a>
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I would like to focus on improving the accessibility of my work by incorporating assistive technologies attributes and markups. This will help ensure that my work is accessible to a wider audience, including people with disabilities.
